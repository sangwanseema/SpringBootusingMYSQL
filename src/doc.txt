IOC container : inversion of control:
externalize the object creation
IOC: spring create object for us using IOC
IOC: contain all the objects
Application context: it is a way to implement ioc container

IOC and Application context are

if @component annotation on the top any classes
it means that IOC contain that class

Annotation :can write for class ,interface , field , method
it provides information for class, interface , field , method
based on type of annotation

Beans: it language of spring bean is an object
@component :-> class is automatically registered as spring bean


@springBootApplication
annotation
always apply on main class which contain method
entry point of application
3 task
1) @configuration
@Bean annotation apply on functions not on class
 bean is made by @Component  and @RestController
 if we use configuration on the top any class
 then we can  create beans with the help of functions

2)EnableAutoConfiguration:

3)ComponentScan : IOC container or Application context
we will do all work inside the base package else it will not
be scanned

@Autowired
use to create object of a class
ex Autowired
   private Dog obj;
    it means that we want an object of dog class

RESTAPI:representational state transfer Application programming interface

HTTP: GET--> to read , PUT--> to update  , POST--> to create  , DELETE--> to delete
RESTAPI=url+HTTP
url =ip+port+api end point


@RestController



controllers
special type of classes  or components which handles http request

method inside controller should be public so that they can be access and invoked by spring framework or external http request


mongodb --> connection--> set the properties
 inf form of key value pair
 key:value


 controller -->call services --->call repository



ResponseEntity: it is class and is part of the springboot framework and is commonly
used in springboot application
to customize the http response
It provide methods to setting the response status , headers and body
you can us it to return different type of  data in your controller methods such as
json , xml or html




Add Lombok
Its a library which automatically add setter,getter or constrcutors during compilation
 whenwe add some depedency in pom.xml then represh it a small icon on right side then it download
 depenecies

and also give annotation on the top of entity class
like @Getter ,@Setter etc


classpath: list of jars and directories used by jvm
priority
cmd
application .properties
application.yml

when we cretae an api it is recommended to test it
two type
1)unit testing
2)Integeration testing
Junit: java unit framework for unit testing


code coverage
--> tell how much code we tested
